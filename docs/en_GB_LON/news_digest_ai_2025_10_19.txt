A renewed push is underway in London to introduce women-only train carriages on the Underground. Advocates argue these dedicated spaces would help protect women from harassment and assault during their commutes. The proposal has sparked debate about safety measures versus potential segregation concerns. Supporters point to similar systems already operating in countries like Japan and India, while critics question whether separating passengers addresses the root causes of harassment on public transport.

British retailer Marks and Spencer is expanding its presence in the capital with a significant store refresh initiative. The company plans to open half a dozen newly designed or upgraded locations across London by Christmas twenty twenty-five. This investment signals the retailer's confidence in physical shopping despite the growth of online commerce, and represents a major commitment to enhancing the customer experience in one of its most important markets.
